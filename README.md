# Flacuties Week 2: Code Challenge.

This is a simple app to conduct a poll to choose the cutest animal!
Iam to create the front-end for the app.

The user of app is supposed to:

1. See a list of all animal names. You will need to make a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve
 the character data.


2.  Click on an animal’s name to see its details i.e image and number of votes. Note, you should only be displaying the
 details of one animal at a time. You can either use the character information from your first request, or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details.


3.  When viewing an animal’s details, I should be able to add the number of votes for each animal.
 This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details.

##  Bonus Deliverables
The bonus deliverables are meant to give me a bit of an extra  challengewant an extra challenge.

	1. Add a reset button that resets the votes back to 0
	2.Have a form for adding animals.
